Python must be installed on the PC to run this!!!!!!!!!!!!
There are some libraries that may not be on the machine so it would be handy to have pip installed
to make it easy to install these libraries is needed.
Imports are listed below:

import sys
import os
import math 
from statistics import mode

Open this directory in terminal or cmd or any sort of command line

You should be at ......\SourceCode\part1>

From here, you can run the python file and give a training(first parameter) and test set(second parameter)

To call it should look something like this:
py wineNearestNeighbour.py wine-training wine-test
