Expected output when data is split into training and test

PS D:\2022\comp307\Assignment1\SourceCode\part3> py PerceptronSplitSets.py ionosphere.data
Using weight:  -28  And Bias:  -10  This was the highest accuracy that I could find
it has been  394 Iterations. The results are above
Accuracy =  187 / 211     88.62559241706161
